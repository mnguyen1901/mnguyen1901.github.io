# Project description
This is a project that look at 20 years of research funded by NCI to the department of radiation oncology and diagnostic radiology. Our method relies on sequential clustering of existing biomedical-based word embeddings, naming using subject matter experts, and visualization to discover trends at a macroscopic scale above individual topics. Details of our method can be found on arXiv[^1]
